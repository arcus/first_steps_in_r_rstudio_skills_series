Today, we're in session three, right smack dab in the middle of our work together.\n:::\n\n## Session 5 Itinerary {.smaller}\n\nPutting it All Together: Communicating\n\n  * Create a new document\n  * Explore a question\n  * Create a visualization\n  * Next steps for using R/RStudio\n  \nGoals:\n\n- Use text and markdown to describe analysis tasks in an organized, attractive document\n- Find useful examples from previous code and apply them to current work\n- Work with error messages and help files successfully\n\n::: notes\nToday, we're really going to work independently and try to make today a \"lab day\", where you take what you've learned in the first four sessions to make some of your own decisions and create a document where YOU are in charge of the data exploration.\n\nMy goals for you today include the following.  \n\nI'd like for you to create a new document that will communicate some data findings, and in that document, I want you to use text and markdown to describe your analysis tasks.  To be effective, you're going to need to go back to some of the code you've worked on before and borrow some code, and you'll need to deal with mistakes and setbacks, error messages and help messages.  You have a warm and helpful group of friends here that will help you in chat!\n:::\n\n## Your Turn! {.smaller}\n\n* Go to https://posit.cloud and log in.\n* Find your First Steps in R and RStudio project and open it\n* In the file browser (lower right), navigate to Exercises\n* Open session_5_exercise.qmd, and start reading and working in it!\n* If you **save** this file, save it with your initials at the end (rename it).\n* If you get stuck, there's a solutions file in the \"solutions\" folder, or jump into chat!\n* I'd love for everyone to work quietly for around 15 minutes, and then I'll demo some of the solution.\n* I'll stop us all for a couple of closing slides and for Q&A as we get close to the end of the hour.\n\n\n\n\n## Q&A / Was This Effective? {.smaller}\n\nWe like to measure our effectiveness (and analyze it in R!)\n\nGoals:\n\n- Describe what an \"aesthetic mapping\" is in ggplot2\n- Create a simple ggplot2 data visualization\n- Add a label (like a title or an x-axis label) to a plot in ggplot2\n\n\n::: notes\n\nThe Arcus education team is a group that likes to measure our effectiveness and make changes based on what we learn.  So before we do questions and answers and our final slides, we like to make sure to give our learners a poll to see if we made a good use of your time.  We're going to ask if we were effective in reaching our goals today, and those goals are on the screen in order to help you answer that question.  Once you answer that poll, feel free to type a question into chat or come off mute and ask to clarify anything I can explain a bit better.  \n\n:::\n\n",
