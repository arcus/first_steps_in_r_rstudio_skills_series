Thanks again for joining us, and welcome to our session today!   My name is ______ [add pronouns here if you want], and I'll be leading today's session.

I've already talked a bit about Arcus in the first session of this Skills Series, but I'm including the slide here so that you have those links available in case you want to learn more about Arcus.

Arcus education provides data science training to researchers ...

(and often this is useful to non-researchers too!).

## First Steps in R and RStudio {.smaller}

Arcus Education provides "Skills Series" for the entire CHOP community.

This Skills Series is a 5-session series aimed at helping you take your first steps in R and RStudio!

-   Session 1: Review and Setup
-   Session 2: Projects and File Ingestion
-   Session 3: Exploring Data Visually, Using ggplot2
-   Session 4: Selecting Data Using dplyr
-   Session 5: Putting it All Together: Communicating

::: notes
Just a reminder about what you're in today.

This is a five-session series, and our goal is to help you get started taking your first steps.  Today, we're in session three, right smack dab in the middle of our work together.
:::

## Session 5 Itinerary {.smaller}

Putting it All Together: Communicating

  * Create a new document
  * Explore a question
  * Create a visualization
  * Next steps for using R/RStudio
  
Goals:

- Use text and markdown to describe analysis tasks in an organized, attractive document
- Find useful examples from previous code and apply them to current work
- Work with error messages and help files successfully

::: notes
Today, we're really going to work independently and try to make today a "lab day", where you take what you've learned in the first four sessions to make some of your own decisions and create a document where YOU are in charge of the data exploration.

My goals for you today include the following.  

I'd like for you to create a new document that will communicate some data findings, and in that document, I want you to use text and markdown to describe your analysis tasks.  To be effective, you're going to need to go back to some of the code you've worked on before and borrow some code, and you'll need to deal with mistakes and setbacks, error messages and help messages.  You have a warm and helpful group of friends here that will help you in chat!

## Q&A / Was This Effective? {.smaller}

We like to measure our effectiveness (and analyze it in R!)

Goals:

- Describe what an "aesthetic mapping" is in ggplot2
- Create a simple ggplot2 data visualization
- Add a label (like a title or an x-axis label) to a plot in ggplot2


::: notes

The Arcus education team is a group that likes to measure our effectiveness and make changes based on what we learn.  So before we do questions and answers and our final slides, we like to make sure to give our learners a poll to see if we made a good use of your time.  We're going to ask if we were effective in reaching our goals today, and those goals are on the screen in order to help you answer that question.  Once you answer that poll, feel free to type a question into chat or come off mute and ask to clarify anything I can explain a bit better.
